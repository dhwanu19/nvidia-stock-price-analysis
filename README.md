* This project is in progress, with current efforts focused on incorporating ensemble deep learning techniques and enhancing the quality of our reports.
### Summary
This project focuses on analyzing Nvidia's stock prices through various computational models. It utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for implementing models like ARIMA, LSTM-RNN, and XGBoost, among others, to predict stock price movements. The repository contains a mix of Python notebooks for model training and evaluation, along with a report detailing the findings of the analysis. The project is designed for those interested in financial market analysis, machine learning applications in stock price prediction, and Nvidia's stock performance specifically. The results indicated by our models indicate [insert demonstrative metric].

### Predictive Model Summary
* ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average): This model is used for forecasting time series data by combining autoregression (AR), differencing (I), and moving averages (MA). It's suitable for data with trends or seasonal patterns.

* LSTM-RNN (Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks): A type of RNN specialized in remembering information for long periods. It's highly effective for sequential data like time series, making it ideal for stock price predictions.

* XGBoost: Stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting, a scalable and accurate implementation of gradient boosting machines. It's known for its performance and speed in classification and regression tasks, including financial market predictions.

### Technical Analysis
* Descriptive Statistics: Summarizes key trends, patterns, and outliers in the data, using measures like mean, median, standard deviation, and range.

* Correlation Analysis: Identifies the relationships between different variables, such as stock prices and trading volume, using correlation coefficients to assess the strength and direction of these relationships.

* Time Series Analysis: Examines stock price movements over time, identifying trends, seasonal patterns, and cyclicality, often using autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions.
